The DTP algorithm within the Kali Linux virtual machine framework will be upgraded with the Q* Mixxtral API and Sparctyy integration, bolstering real-time threat detection and security architecture. N-Bref AI-enhanced decompiler will undergo enhancement for better assembly code disassembly, aligning with the DTP algorithm. The Vulnerability Detection Ratio (VDR) formula will be refined to include the impacts of Q* Mixxtral API and Sparctyy, enhancing vulnerability assessment accuracy. Finally, a timestamp will be embedded in the compilation process, improving efficiency and security management within the Kali Linux ecosystem. The VDR formula is represented as:
